Ola Booking Analysis Project
Project Overview
The Ola Booking Analysis Project aims to analyze ride booking data from the Ola platform to gain insights into customer behavior, ride patterns, service performance, and driver efficiency. The analysis is conducted using SQL queries on a structured database that captures various attributes of ride bookings, including booking status, customer ratings, vehicle types, and payment methods.

Objectives
Identify peak booking hours and popular vehicle types.

Analyze customer behavior, including repeat customers and booking patterns.

Evaluate ride efficiency by examining cancellation rates and ride completion rates.

Assess driver performance through customer ratings and service quality metrics.

Provide actionable insights to improve service offerings based on data-driven findings.

Database Setup
To set up the database for this project, the following SQL command was used to create the ola_booking table:

sql
CREATE TABLE ola_booking (
    Date DATE,
    Time TIME,
    Booking_ID VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    Booking_Status VARCHAR(25),
    Customer_ID VARCHAR(25),
    Vehicle_Type VARCHAR(25),
    Pickup_Location VARCHAR(25),
    Drop_Location VARCHAR(25),
    V_TAT VARCHAR(25),
    C_TAT VARCHAR(25),
    Canceled_Rides_by_Customer VARCHAR(50),
    Canceled_Rides_by_Driver VARCHAR(40),
    Incomplete_Rides VARCHAR(25),
    Incomplete_Rides_Reason VARCHAR(25),
    Booking_Value BIGINT,
    Payment_Method VARCHAR(25),
    Ride_Distance VARCHAR(25),
    Driver_Ratings VARCHAR(25),
    Customer_Rating VARCHAR(25)
);
Findings
The analysis yielded several key findings:

Peak Booking Hours: The top 3 peak booking hours were identified based on ride volume.

Common Vehicle Type: The most frequently booked vehicle type by repeat customers was determined.

Repeat Customers: The percentage of repeat customers in the dataset was calculated.

Payment Method Ranking: Payment methods were ranked by their total contribution to booking value.

Ride Cancellation Reasons: The top reasons for ride cancellations by customers and drivers were identified.

Ride Completion Rate: The completion rate for rides was computed for each city.

Demand Analysis: The most in-demand vehicle type during peak hours was analyzed by city.

Conclusion
The Ola Booking Analysis Project provides valuable insights into customer preferences, ride patterns, and service performance. By leveraging data analytics, Ola can enhance its service offerings, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize operational efficiency. Future work may involve implementing changes based on these findings and continuously monitoring performance metrics to ensure sustained improvements.
